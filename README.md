<h2>👨‍💻 Foot Locker & Champs Sports Risk Assessment Reports:</h2>

- <b>Scope and goals of the audit
Scope: The scope is defined as the entire security program at Foot Locker/Champs Sports. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.
Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Foot Locker/Champs Sports’s security posture.

- <h1>Current assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 

<b>●On-premises equipment for in-office business needs

●	Internet access

●	Internal network

●	Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 

- <h1>Risk assessment $ Risk Discription
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Foot Locker and Champs Sports does not have all the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with Canada and international regulations and standards. 

- <h1>Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Foot Locker and Champs Sports will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.

- <h1>Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 7, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance with best practices.

- <h1>Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Foot Locker does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

- <b>Currently, all Foot Locker/Champs Sports employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII.
- <b>Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database. 
- <b>Access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
- <b>The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
- <b>The IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
- <b>Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. 
- <b>The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS).
- <b>There is no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data. 
- <b>The IT department has established a plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, privacy policies, procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees, to properly document and maintain data.
- <b>Although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements (e.g., at least eight characters, a combination of letters and at least one number; special characters). 
- <b>There is no centralized password management system that enforces the password policy’s minimum requirements, which sometimes affects productivity when employees/vendors submit a ticket to the IT department to recover or reset a password.
- <b>While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear.
- <b>The store’s physical location, which includes Foot Locker and Champs Sports  main offices, store front, and warehouse of products, has sufficient locks, up-to-date closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance, as well as functioning fire detection and prevention systems.
- <b>In addition, the IT teams must implement and deploy MFA (Multifactor Authentication) or two step verification for all Foot Locker and Champs Sports companies in Canada to prevent unauthorized users to access sensitive information.
